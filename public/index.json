    "content": "Resilient Scale aims to scale our customers' technical capabilities and effectiveness - resiliently. We do this by working collaboratively with our customers to solve problems and transfer knowledge. We focus on improving organizational efficiency through process and technology while improving working environments. After all, we value, respect, and empathize with the employees of our customers.\nOur principles Life is short, and we spend a lot of time at work. It sounds cliche, but we all have one short life to live. Therefore, we value people above all else. Whether our people or our customers, we put people\u0026rsquo;s well-being, enjoyment, and success above all else.\nWe do our best work when we care about our people, our customers, and our work. Therefore we prioritize:\n mutual respect self-care fair compensation open, honest communication and feedback inclusive and supportive environments embracing the diversity of backgrounds and perspectives empathy-based decision making winning work we feel good about doing what is right for our people and our customers saying \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; when appropriate  Our vision Our vision for Resilient Scale is to be the preeminent trusted partner for our customers while being a fantastic place to work. We believe our priorities allow us to best serve our customers by impacting their bottom line and making their organization a better place to work.\nAbove all else, we want to be known for being good people, good partners, and good technologists.\nOur plan The tech industry is ripe with people and companies looking for a big payday. Too many times, this comes at the expense of employee health, well-being, and compensation. As a company, we are disgusted by the discrepancy in pay between the executives and employees. We are disgusted by the lack of transparency and \u0026ldquo;buzzword core-values\u0026rdquo; applied by employees but not executives and decision-makers. Resilient Scale will never be one of these companies.\nWe will grow while maintaining profitability and sharing our success with our employees. We achieve this by clearly understanding our costs and being careful and selective about the contracts we sign. Controlled, long-term growth with a focus on profitability is our game.\n"

    "content": "As an employee, you are responsible for behaving appropriately at work. We outline our expectations here. We can’t cover every case of conduct, but we trust you to always use your best judgement. Reach out if you face any issues or have any questions.\nCyber security and digital devices This section deals with all things digital at work. We want to set some guidelines for using computers, phones, internet connection, and social media to ensure security and protect our assets.\nYou must not use company assets and/or information systems to:\n Download or upload obscene, offensive, or illegal material. Send confidential information to unauthorized recipients. Invade another person’s privacy and gain access to sensitive information. Download or upload pirated movies, music, material, or software.

Send insulting or discriminatory messages and content.  Corporate social media expectations If you handle our social media accounts or speak on our company’s behalf, we expect you to protect our company’s image and reputation. Specifically, you should:\n Be respectful, polite, and patient. Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise when possible. Follow our confidentiality and data protection policies and observe laws governing copyrights, trademarks, plagiarism, and fair use. Coordinate with our [PR/Marketing department] when you’re about to share any major impact content. Avoid deleting or ignoring comments for no reason. Correct or remove any misleading or false content as quickly as possible.  Conflict of interest Conflicts of interest arise when your personal goals no longer align with your responsibilities towards the company. For this reason, conflicts of interest are a serious issue for all of us. We expect you to be vigilant to spot circumstances that create conflicts of interest, either for yourself or your direct reports. Follow our policies and always act in our company’s best interests. If you are experiencing an ethical dilemma, talk to us, and we will try to help you resolve it.\nEmployee relationships We want to ensure that relationships between employees are appropriate and harmonious. Therefore, we outline our guidelines, and we ask you always to behave professionally.\nFraternization Fraternization refers to dating or being friends with your colleagues. In this policy, “dating” equals consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations. Non-consensual relationships constitute sexual violence, and we prohibit them explicitly.\nDating colleagues If you start dating a colleague, we expect you to maintain professionalism and keep personal discussions outside our workplace.\nYou are also obliged to respect your colleagues who date each other. We won’t tolerate sexual jokes, malicious gossip, or improper comments. If you witness this kind of behavior, please report it to HR.\nDating managers Supervisors must not date their direct reports to avoid accusations of favoritism, abuse of authority, and sexual harassment. This restriction extends to every manager above an employee.\nAlso, if you act as a hiring manager, you aren’t allowed to hire your partner to your team. However, you can refer them for employment to other teams or departments where you don’t have any managerial or hiring authority.\nFriendships at work Employees who work together may naturally form friendships either in or outside of the workplace. We encourage this relationship between peers, as it can help you communicate and collaborate. However, we expect you to focus on your work and keep personal disputes outside of our workplace.\nEmployment of relatives Everyone in our company should be hired, recognized, or promoted because of their skills, character, and work ethic. We would not like to see phenomena of nepotism, favoritism, or conflicts of interest, so we will place some restrictions on hiring employees’ relatives.\nTo our company, a “relative” is related by blood or marriage within the third degree to an employee. This includes: parents, grandparents, in-laws, spouses or domestic partners, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, step-parents, step-children, and adopted children.\n"

    "content": "We are a small business, and therefore we typically hire for specific contracts rather than maintain a large bench. We explain our hiring process and outline what to expect if you decide to apply - which we hope you do!\nInterviewing Our typical interview process typically involves three steps. All interviews are conducted remotely.\n  Background interview \u0026amp; company questions (90 minutes): In the background interview, we discuss your experiences. We will ask questions about projects, situations, and approaches. We also provide ample time for you to ask us questions about the company, our culture, and our projects.\n  Technical interview (90 minutes): We collaboratively work through a technical problem and solution in the technical interview. The purpose here is to implement something simple while discussing the broader considerations and challenges.\n  Feedback \u0026amp; finalization (30 minutes): The last step is to reconvene to provide feedback to the candidate and allow for additional questions and feedback from the candidate.\n  Offers and Onboarding We typically hire initially for specific contracts. As we stated above, keeping a bench is far too costly for a small business. Therefore, we work to match people with projects to ensure a good fit for all. We will discuss potential projects with you and allow you to decide if they are the correct fit.\nResponding to RFPs We may also be hiring contingent upon successfully winning a contract via an RFP (request for proposal). In this case, we again find the right people for the project and work together on crafting the strongest RFP response possible. You may be asked to:\n Document experiences to be used in the RFP response Participate in oral interviews with the prospective customer Sign a letter of intent to participate upon the award  In these cases, we will always aim to minimize the amount of work and involvement you must do. We have proposal writers who will handle the bulk of the work in this process and will only look to you to input your unique experiences.\nUpon award, we will schedule the project kickoff. At this point, you can provide notice to your existing employer and join Resilient Scale!\n"

These policies help us build a productive, lawful, and pleasant workplace.\nConfidentiality and data protection We want to ensure that private information about clients, employees, partners, and our company is well-protected. Examples of confidential information are:\n Employee records Unpublished financial information Data of customers/partners/vendors Customer lists (existing and prospective) Unpublished goals, forecasts, and initiatives marked as confidential  We may ask you to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as part of our hiring process. We also commit to:\n Restrict and monitor access to sensitive data. Develop transparent data collection procedures. Establish data and computing resource protection practices.  We expect you to act responsibly when handling confidential information pertaining to Resilient Scale, our customers, or prospective customers.\nYou must:\n Lock or secure confidential information at all times. Shred confidential documents when they are no longer needed. Make sure you view confidential information on secure devices only. Only disclose information to other employees when it is necessary and authorized.  You must not:\n Use confidential information for your personal benefit or profit. Disclose confidential information to anyone outside of our company. Replicate confidential documents and files and store them on insecure devices.  This policy is important for our company’s legality and reputation. We will terminate any employee who breaches our confidentiality guidelines for personal profit.\nWe may also discipline any unintentional breach of this policy depending on its frequency and seriousness. We will terminate employees who repeatedly disregard this policy, even when they do so unintentionally.\nHarassment and violence To build a happy and productive workplace, we need everyone to treat others well and help them feel safe. In addition, each of us should do our part to prevent harassment and workplace violence.\nWorkplace harassment Harassment is a broad term and may include seemingly harmless actions, like gossip. We cannot create an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider harassment:\n Sabotaging someone’s work on purpose. Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature. Commenting derogatorily on a person’s physical characteristics, ethnic heritage, or religious beliefs. Starting or spreading rumors about a person’s personal life. Ridiculing someone in front of others or singling them out to perform tasks unrelated to their job (e.g., bringing coffee) against their will.  Sexual harassment is illegal, and we will seriously investigate relevant reports. If an employee is found guilty of sexual harassment, they will be terminated.\nIf you’re being harassed, whether by a colleague, customer, or vendor, you can choose to talk to any of these people:\n Offenders. If you suspect that an offender doesn’t realize they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the harassment. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g., inappropriate jokes between colleagues.) Avoid using this approach with customers or stakeholders. Your manager. If customers, stakeholders, or team members are involved in your claim, you may reach out to your manager. Your manager will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. HR. Feel free to reach out to HR in any case of harassment, no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g., sexual advances) or if your manager is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain confidential.  Workplace violence Violence in our workplace is a serious form of harassment. It includes physical and sexual assault, destruction of property, threats to harm a person or property, and verbal and psychological abuse. We want to avoid those incidents altogether, but we also want to be ready to respond if needed.\nFor this reason, we ask you to:\n Report to HR if you suspect or know that someone is violent. Your report will be confidential, and we will investigate the situation with discretion. Call the police if you feel your or anyone\u0026rsquo;s safety is in imminent danger.  We will treat employees who verbally threaten others as high risk. If we find an employee commits an act of violence, we will terminate that employee and possibly press criminal charges. Employees who damage property deliberately will be solely responsible for paying for it.\nSupporting victims To support victims of workplace violence, we may:\n Cover relevant medical bills. Pay for mental health treatment if needed. Provide victims with our lawyer’s services to help them file lawsuits.  Get help early on If you need help, please ask. Seek help from others early on to mitigate conflicts before tensions escalate.\nIf you experience conflicts with a colleague, ask your manager for advice before tensions escalate. If these conflicts persist, ask us whether you could attend conflict resolution seminars with your colleague. Our workplace is founded on mutual respect, and we won’t allow anyone to compromise this foundation.\n"

We don’t tolerate discrimination against protected characteristics (gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status.) We want all employees (including executives and HR) to treat others with respect and professionalism. In practice, this means that we:\n Hire and promote people based on creating an inclusive, diverse, and empowered workforce. Value diversity and aim to reduce bias in every process. Make accommodations to help people with disabilities move about safely on our premises and use our products, services, and equipment. Use inclusive, diversity-sensitive language in all official documents, signs, and job ads.  Apart from those actions, we commit to penalizing every discriminatory, offensive, or inappropriate behavior. We ask you to report any discriminatory action against yourself or your colleagues to HR to do this properly. Our company will not retaliate against you if you file a complaint or discrimination lawsuit. Any employee who retaliates or discriminates will face disciplinary action.\nAttendance We expect you to be present during your scheduled working hours.

    "content": "In this section, we describe our procedures regarding the resignation and termination of our employees.\nEmployment at-will We remind you that in the U.S., employment is “at-will”. This means that you or our company may terminate our employment relationship at any time and for any non-discriminatory reason.\nResignation You resign when you voluntarily inform HR or your manager that you will stop working for our company. We also consider you resigned if you don’t come to work for five consecutive days without notice.\nYou are not obliged to give us advance notice before resigning. However, for efficiency’s sake, and to make sure our workplace runs smoothly, we ask that you give at least two weeks notice or more, if possible. The more notice we have, the better.\nWe accept verbal resignations, but we prefer that you submit a written and signed notice of resignation for our HR records. We will reply with an acceptance of the resignation letter within two days. HR will inform your manager that you are resigning if you haven’t already done so. Whether you want to announce your resignation to your team is up to you, but we encourage you to be open.\nForced resignation You can resign anytime at your own free will, and nobody should force you into resignation. Forcing someone into resigning (directly or indirectly) is constructive dismissal, and we won’t tolerate it. Specifically, we prohibit employees from:\n Creating a hostile or unpleasant environment. Demanding or coaxing an employee to resign. Victimizing, harassing, or retaliating against an employee. Forcing an employee to resign by taking unofficial adverse actions (e.g., demotions, increased workload).  Termination Terminating an employee is always unpleasant but sometimes necessary. If that happens, we want to ensure we act lawfully and respectfully.\nWe may terminate an employee either for cause or without cause.\nFor cause termination For cause termination is justified when an employee breaches their contract, engages in illegal activities (e.g., embezzlement), disrupts our workplace (e.g., harasses colleagues), performs below acceptable standards, or causes damage or financial loss to our company.\nTermination without cause Without cause termination refers to redundancies or layoffs that may be necessary if we cease some of our operations or re-assign job duties within teams. We will follow applicable laws regarding notice and payouts. We may help employees who were terminated without cause to find work elsewhere, if possible.\nWrongful dismissal If you manage team members, avoid wrongful dismissal. When you terminate an employee for cause, we expect you to be certain you made the right choice and keep accurate performance and/or disciplinary records to support your decision.\nReferences When we terminate employees, we may provide references for those who leave in good standing. This means that employees shouldn’t have been terminated for cause. If you are laid off, you may receive references. Please ask your manager.\nIf you resign, you may ask for references, and your manager has a right to oblige or refuse.\n"

We provide information on our health insurance plans and benefits, like work-from-home options and company-issued equipment.\nEmployee health The health of our employees and their families is very important to us. Unfortunately, the law does not require small businesses to offer healthcare in the United States. However, we feel this is an important, fundamental human right. We, therefore, offer healthcare to all of our employees.\nWe offer health care, vision, and dental coverage for employees and their dependents. For details on the plans, including the amounts covered by Resilient Scale, see the benefits link in Gusto.\nWorkers’ compensation We strive to keep our workplace safe, but accidents may happen occasionally. When appropriate, employees who are injured at work (by accident or disease) can receive wage replacement, medical care, and rehabilitation benefits according to workers’ compensation laws. Please inform us of your injury as soon as possible. Ask us for the forms you need to file a claim or contact your state agency for workers’ compensation.\nOur company has a workers’ compensation policy according to the guidelines of the states we operate in (currently Colorado).\nWorkers' compensation information for the state of Colorado is available here: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/dwc.\nRemote-first We are a remote-first company and believe our employees can work successfully from wherever you choose to be. Therefore, we strive to obtain remote-first contracts to minimize the travel requirements and costs as well as time away from your family and friends.\nHowever, you may be required to travel for:\n Meetings Conferences Training Customer work  While we do not dictate where you are working from, specific contracts may have core hour requirements.\nEmployee expenses We will reimburse employees for approved expenses related to the direct execution of their employment. All expenses, with receipts, are to be entered into Harvest. Reimbursements will be processed within two pay periods via direct deposit.\nWe require employees to use sound judgment when incurring expenses, particularly as related to travel. We expect employees to select cost-effective options, provided they do overly inconvenience our employees. If you are unsure whether a significant expenditure is appropriate, please ask your manager before incurring the expense.\nSome contracts will have additional requirements regarding expenses that must be adhered to.\nCompany-issued equipment As an employee, you will receive a laptop and possibly other devices. Unless otherwise mentioned in your contract, any equipment we offer belongs to our company, and you may not sell it or give it away. You are also responsible for keeping our equipment safe and in good condition. If your equipment breaks or malfunctions, let us know so we can arrange to get it repaired.\nTheft and damage of company equipment Our equipment is insured for theft and damage. We ask you to inform us as soon as possible if your equipment is stolen or damaged. We might be able to trace stolen devices. Please also file a theft statement (affidavit) with the police and submit a copy to us.\nAll Apple products will also have an Apple Care policy.\nSecurity of company-issued devices We advise you to keep your company-issued computer, tablet, and cell phone secure. You can do this if you:\n Keep all devices password-protected. Always use multi-factor authentication for all devices and services that support it. Ensure you do not leave your devices unattended. Install security updates for browsers and other systems as soon as updates are available. Do not disable security software provided by the company, including anti-virus.  Equity We plan to share our profits with employees through benefits and structured profit-sharing programs. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t plan on sharing equity as these programs are often an accounting nightmare. They typically create false hope of a big payday and are often manipulated by executives at the expense of employee well-being. Instead, our focus is on long-term viability and growth.\nYou can see this focus reflected in our current benefits offering. In the United States, companies of 50 employees or less do not have to offer healthcare (and most do not). However, we believe the well-being of our people is paramount. Therefore, we offer high-quality healthcare for all employees and dependents.\nWe plan to add benefits as our financial position allows. And in the unlikely event of a high-value exit, we will do the right thing for all employees.\n"

    "description": "",
    "content": "In this section, we outline our guidelines for compensating employees according to their employment status. We also describe our performance management and employee development policies.\nCompensation status There are two types of employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines:\n  Non-exempt employees who are covered by the FLSA’s minimum wage and overtime provisions.\n  Exempt employees, who aren’t covered by the FLSA because they meet three exemption criteria: (a) they are paid at least $23,600 per year ($455 per week), (b) they are paid on a salary basis, and (c) they perform exempt job duties (“executive,” “professional,” and “administrative”). Most employees must meet all three criteria to be exempt.\n  If you are unsure as to whether you should be exempt or not, please ask HR to clarify your status.\nThe FLSA excludes some types of jobs (e.g. railroad workers, truck drivers) because they are covered by other federal laws. Some other workers, like outside salespeople, are excluded by definition. Feel free to ask us for clarifications at any time.\nOvertime We will always do our best to ensure overtime is not needed by planning and executing projects effectively. Overworking and burnout are rarely worth it. However, if we can\u0026rsquo;t avoid it, it is important to know:\n Exempt employees are not entitled to overtime pay by federal law. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay of one and a half times their wage.  Payroll We pay your salary or wage on the 15th and last day of the month via direct deposit through our payroll provider, Gusto.\nPerformance management We have built our performance management practices to:\n Ensure you understand your job responsibilities and have specific goals to meet. Provide you with actionable and timely feedback on your work. Invest in development opportunities that help you grow professionally. Recognize and reward your work in financial or non-financial ways (e.g., employee awards.)  Objectives Our collective objectives include: The impact of our work. The financial performance of the company. The well-being of our people. We believe we can be a profitable, impactful, and successful company while being an excellent place for all of us. Therefore, we will be open and transparent regarding individual objectives necessary to meet our collective goals.\nWe anticipate every employee will have goals regarding billable work and non-billable internal work. These goals and how we arrived at them will be discussed, communicated regularly, and continually re-evaluated.\nFeedback We believe in an open feedback model. We encourage you to give us timely feedback any time it may be relevant and will do the same with you. We do not believe in scheduled performance reviews or overbearing performance review processes.\nCareer growth We believe our team must never stop learning. Technology is a broad and diverse field, and there are many growth opportunities. If you would like to be involved in a specific conference, speaking opportunity, meetup, training class, certification, or other career advancement elements, please ask us about it. We can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee we can fund all of your requests, but we will do our best if it aligns with our mission and goals.\n"

We believe together we can manage our need for profitability while enjoying our lives outside of work.\nScope This policy applies to full-time employees of the company.\nPolicy details We expect employees to use the total PTO allowed per year. We want to minimize exhaustion and burnout. It can be easy to get caught up in our work, but we all must step away at times. We believe that collectively we can meet our profitability goals and still have a great work/life balance. We do believe not taking time off can compromise your performance and well-being. Hence, we reserve the right to enforce time away from work if needed.\nWhile we prefer you take all available PTO in a given calendar year, you are permitted to carry over four days (32 hours) per year.\nThis policy doesn’t interfere with legally established leaves like maternity and paternity leave.\nTime off procedure We believe we are all responsible and respectful people who can manage work obligations and personal time. As an employee, you are obliged to:\n Enter known time off requests are requested in Gusto. Avoid abusing the policy and negatively impacting your job performance and the company. Communicate and coordinate with your team to ensure everyone takes leave. This includes supporting your teammates on projects so everyone can take leave. Plan to delegate, postpone, or otherwise manage projects that will be affected by time off. Give us as much notice as possible of upcoming time off. Get approval for time off of a week or longer. This is intended to ensure we can sufficiently cover our obligations, not as a gating factor.  We can consider rejecting time off requests if:\n Other team members with similar or complementary duties have already asked for leave during the same time. The time in question is too busy or includes an important deadline for the employee asking for leave. An employee appears to abuse the policy. Supervisors have to prove that this is the case, using leave data and presenting evidence of employees’ inadequate deliverables.  We will never reject leave requests for any of the following reasons:\n To discipline employees. To force employees to fulfill duties that aren’t urgent. To approve leave for another employee who made a later request.  Neither list is exhaustive. Effective communication between team members and common sense is vital to make this policy work for everyone.\nThe company will review this policy annually and address any issues.\nOut of office notice If you will be out of the office/unavailable, create a calendar entry in the corporate calendar. We ask that you be diligent about this so we can quickly see who is available and who is out of the office.\n"
