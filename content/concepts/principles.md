As you get more familiar with SkyLounge, it can be helpful to understand the first principles we use in building and evolving SkyLounge.

**Complement your flow**: We aim to make SkyLounge blend into your flow and effectively fade into the background during development. You will notice there is very little to do in this dashboard application. Skylounge leverages existing capabilities in GitHub, including pull requests and issues whenever possible.

**Keep developers in control**: SkyLounge aims to keep developers in control, not just of application-specific automation, but over the entire automation process. For this reason, SkyLounge never commits directly to the main branch of repositories. Instead, it uses branches and pull requests to show developers what it would like to do. 

**Reuse, reuse, reuse... unless you can't**: There is so much duplication in automation across software teams. SkyLounge aims to remove that. However, there are always exceptions. SkyLounge should never stand in the way of what you need to do, whatever the reason.

**Knowledge is power**: SkyLounge strives to communicate the complex merging of blueprints, workflow templates, configuration, jobs, and steps. Pull requests clearly show what changed so developers can make informed decisions about when to accept updates.
