SkyLounge provides better automation to software organizations. It introduces composability into automation, removing duplication and handling updates automatically. SkyLounge allows an organization to define and manage standard automation centrally in a Git repository, leaving application-specific automation to be provided by the development teams. While SkyLounge continuously rolls out updates, developers remain in control.

SkyLounge is built on GitHub Actions and Workflows. It leverages well-known tools including GitHub repositories, pull requests, and issues. SkyLounge fits into your flow and fades into the background, requiring very little knowledge to use the system.

With SkyLounge, organizations create shared understanding by establishing common patterns for building, deploying, testing, traceability, security, compliance, and more.
