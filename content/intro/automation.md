Regardless of the industry, the same questions kept emerging. So we share some based on three roles, a developer, an engineering manager, and a security and compliance officer.

**Are you a developer?**

- How long does it take to build automation for your application? 
- How much time do you dedicate to automation maintenance and upgrades?
- Is your automation an asset during incidents?

**Are you an engineering manager?**

- How much duplication exists in automation across all of your applications?
- If you were to move engineers to another team in the organization, how long would it take them to get up to speed?
- How do these realities affect your ability to ship new features?

**Are you a security and compliance officer?**

- How many security and compliance requirements are automated, and how many are up to date?
- How long does it take to implement a new security scan and roll it out to every team?
- How hard is it to track and report on the above?

Regardless of the customer, we kept seeing the same pattern. Teams would implement the same automation differently. Developer teams would be provided with a large ecosystem of plugins but left to integrate it themselves. Versions of automation components would vary widely. Security and compliance were not first-class citizens in automation due to the amount of time invested in the "baseline" automation. In organizations with "standard" automation, developers lose all control.
