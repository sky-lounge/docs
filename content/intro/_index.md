Resilient Scale is a consultancy focused on developer and organizational efficiency driven by technology. Over the years, we have worked with various customers of all sizes, from commercial to government, leveraging a wide range of technology stacks. Across this varied work, patterns emerged.

All of our customers understand the value of automation to some extent. They know that automation is a requirement. They understand the impact automation has on efficiency, consistency, and security. But they also understand the challenges they face.

* Automation requires a significant investment of time and resources.
* Automation needs maintenance, or it becomes a liability.
* Automation is itself a product that needs to evolve.

As crucial as automation is, it does not directly contribute to new customer-facing capabilities.
