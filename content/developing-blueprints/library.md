You can create a library of reusable workflow templates, job definitions, and step definitions in your `skylounge-definitions` repository. Because these elements are referred to by URI, the path in the repository does not matter. However, we recommend you create directories like `workflow-templates`, `jobs`, and `steps` if you decide to proceed this way.
