Put yourself in the shoes of developers, engineer managers, and security and compliance officers, and ask yourself the following questions:

*Developers:*

- How long does it take to build automation for your application? 
- How much time do you dedicate to automation maintenance and upgrades?
- Is your automation an asset during incidents?

*Engineering managers:*

- How much duplication exists in automation across all of your applications?
- If you were to move engineers to another team in the organization, how long would it take them to get up to speed?
- How do these realities affect your ability to ship new features?

*Security and compliance officers:*

- How many security and compliance requirements are automated, and how many are current?
- How long does implementing a new security scan and rolling it out to every team/application/repository take?
- How hard is it to track and report on security scanning across your organization?

So what do you think? Is there room for improvement in your organization?

### Introducing SkyLounge

SkyLounge provides _better automation to software organizations_. SkyLounge allows an organization to define and manage common automation centrally in a Git repository, leaving application-specific automation to be provided by the development teams. So while SkyLounge continuously rolls out updates, developers remain in control.

SkyLounge extends the GitHub Actions platform and blends into your existing work flows. It leverages well-known tools, including GitHub repositories, pull requests, and issues. As a result, SkyLounge fits into your flow and fades into the background, requiring very little knowledge to use the system. With SkyLounge, organizations create shared understanding by establishing common patterns for building, deploying, testing, traceability, security, compliance, and more.
