SkyLounge brings better automation to software organizations. _But what does this mean?_

Today, most organizations understand the importance of automation in the form of continuous integration and continuous delivery. However, effective automation goes far beyond just CI/CD. Modern automation encompasses the entire lifecycle of secure software development and delivery, from building to provisioning and deployment, security scanning, compliance checks and reporting, and more. Modern automation meets the needs of the entire organization. Yet only 18% of respondents to the [ 2022 ACCELERATE State of DevOps Report](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops)  strongly agreed with the statement:

> “At my company, the software security protocol is seamlessly built into our development process.”

### We can do better

We believe we can do better, and the world seems to agree. The world is waking up to the value provided by platform engineering teams. Focus on secure software continues to increase. Investment into platforms and tooling is growing. And the results speak for themselves:

> "From developers to operations to security to senior IT business leaders, platform engineering substantially benefits both business and technical objectives." <br /><sub>[State of DevOps Report 2023](https://www.puppet.com/resources/state-of-platform-engineering)<sub>


Our decades of software development and consulting experience have taught us:

* Automation requires a significant investment of time and resources.
* Automation needs maintenance, or it becomes a liability.
* Automation is itself a product that needs to evolve.

Modern automation makes organizations more efficient, secure, and effective. Modern automation is at the heart of the platform engineering movement. SkyLounge is the platform to make it happen.
